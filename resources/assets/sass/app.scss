     * TODO FIX THE DAMN HEADER.
     * - make it smaller. It's not as important as the rest of the page!
     * - SMALLER LOGO. Esp since this isn't a shop. Nothing to sell = no need for brand recognition = logo is pointless. NO LOGO?????
     * - start designing navigation from mobile. Just 3 elements? WHICH ONES???
     * - do we need search???? (and if yes, where should it go?)
