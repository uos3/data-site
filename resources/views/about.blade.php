			    <p>UoS­<sup>3</sup> is a project of the University of Southampton to design, build and fly a CubeSat.&nbsp; Also known as the <em>University of Southampton Small Satellite</em>, UoS<sup>3</sup> is a 10x10x10 cm spacecraft that will allow the University to expand its research while giving students practical experience in spacecraft design and development.</p>
				<p>The University of Southampton has been involved in space debris research for over 20 years and UoS<sup>3</sup> is planning to support that interest.&nbsp; The satellite will collect precise orbit and attitude data as its orbit decay under the influence of atmospheric drag, which will be used to validate re-entry prediction tools.</p>
				<p>The project is under the Astronautics Research Group in the University and is overseen by Dr Adrian Tatnall with help from Aleksander Lidtke and Clemens Rumpf, both PhD students.&nbsp; In addition to this two Masters level Group Design Projects – one from the Faculty of Engineering and Environment (FEE) and one from the School of Electronics and Computer Science (ECS) – comprising of a total of 15 students are working on the design of the spacecraft.&nbsp; The Southampton University Space Flight Society (SUSF) are also involved, designing, building and maintaining the University of Southampton Ground Station.</p>
				<p>In 2012-13 the University ran Project Blast, a high-altitude balloon launch of a CubeSat that utilised Android phone technology.&nbsp; Building on this experience we are now in the process of designing and constructing test pieces to verify of design.&nbsp; This stage will last until spring 2015 after which we hope to be in a position to continue with fabrication of the flight hardware. &nbsp;This is being done, aiming for a launch in 2017/18.</p>
				<p>To ensure our satellite complies with current space debris mitigation guidelines which limit a satellites duration in space to 25 years, the satellite must be launched into an orbit of altitude less than 600 km.&nbsp; To meet this condition we would like to launch UoS<sup>3</sup> from the International Space Station by NanoRacks.&nbsp; We currently do not have funds for this launch.&nbsp; If you would like to support our project visit our <em>Support Us</em> section.&nbsp; Or, if you are an amateur radio operator and would like to be involved as a ground-station for UoS<sup>3</sup> please visit our <em>Get Involved</em> section.</p>
