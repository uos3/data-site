TODO
====

* design homepage
	- redesign: 'satellite news' = narrow band, 'project intro' = ...? NOT a carousel, internet says they're bad at accessibility

* make Profile page
	- fields
	- upload number stats (since XY)

* make About page
* get some rough content from Alec/Phil	

* design Contribute page

* CHECK AND FIX ACCESSIBILITY
	
* user management functionality:
	- email address validation
	- delete user account (keep submissions, remove user id) 

	
* list 'art' ideas (or find them - I have a couple noted down... somewhere...)



DONE
====

- fix login/register layouts (use master.blade.php)
	
- fix upload
- fix unit tests

- look at moodboard: do you still like this?
- brainstorm ideas: colors + style
- try out things in Gimp/Inkscape
- ask: will this work with my own art ideas?
- brainstorm ideas: layout
	
* finish data submission into db (DataController)
	- finish unit test case for blocked user
	- use temp db (Sqlite?) for testing
	- submit data to db
	

- download Pure.js and set up a wireframe for the homepage (user the included Twitter Bootstrap instead)
- pick a font (might change)
- think about possible contents and their visual solutions: page with a longish block of text; graphs; modular (news + illustrations + ??) (modules planned out)
* design other static pages
	- take homepage design and pare it down for text
